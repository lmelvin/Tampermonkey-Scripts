[Here](https://github.com/lmelvin/Tampermonkey-Scripts/raw/master/Netflix_Interactive_Selection_Tracker.user.js)

#### How to use

This script will keep a running log of every option selected during interactive content on netflix.com. In order to export this log, you must use the audio/subtitle menu in Netflix. In this menu you will see a section called *Interactive Selection Tracker* and under that a download option. **This file must be downloaded before you exit out of the content and back to the Netflix menu. Netflix will automatically do this if you are not careful**
